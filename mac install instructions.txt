https://github.com/there-are-higher-beings/quickfix/blob/main/README.md

1. open up a terminal window, and keep it open beside these instructions
2. open up a finder window that contains QUICKFIX
3. go to the terminal window and type in [cd ] (without the square brackets but with the space)
4. from finder, drag quickfix.py into the terminal window
5. click the right-arrow key to deselect the path and delete [quickfix.py] from the terminal line

	at this point the terminal command line should look like:
			cd /Users/YOURNAME/FOLDER/FOLDER 

	(idk how many folders there are on your pc, it should be different for everyone)


6. if the terminal line is as above, press return (or enter)

7. paste in:
			md quickfix.py quickfix.command

	and press return (or enter)

8. paste in:
			chmod +x quickfix.command

	and press return (or enter)

you are then free to double click on quickfix.command whenever you would like to use it
