This is a terminal program that fixes inputted sentences to the best they can be. It saves time by doing that first lookover to catch all the small spelling errors as well as well as grammar errors as well. Simply paste in the desired text, and `quickfix` will quickly and efficiently fix up your document. Please report [issues here](https://github.com/wncry/quickfix/issues).

dependancies: `pip3 install language_tool_python`
