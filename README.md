# general
This is a program to be used after a document is written, to do the initial check-through. Simply paste in the desired text, and `quickfix` will quickly and efficiently fix up your document. `Quickfix` has not been extensivly tested, so while it is in its initial stages, `quickfix` will have a feedback option embeded directly into the program. _pls dont spam :)_

# how it works
`Quickfix` was developed in python to work in inside of Terminal *(command prompt on pc)* for user interaction.
